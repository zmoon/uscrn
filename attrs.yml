      units: null
      description: >-
        Type of infrared surface temperature measurement.
        'R' denotes raw measurements,
        'C' denotes corrected measurements,
        and 'U' indicates unknown/missing.
        See Note G.

      description: "{Maximum,Minimum,Average} relative humidity, in %. See Notes H and I."

  notes:
    A: All fields are separated from adjacent fields by at least one space.
    B: Leading zeros are omitted.
    C: >-
      Missing data are indicated by the lowest possible integer for a
      given column format, such as -9999.0 for 7-character fields with
      one decimal place or -99.000 for 7-character fields with three
      decimal places.
    D: Daily data are calculated using the station's local day.
    E: >-
      There are no quality flags for these derived quantities. When the
      raw data are flagged as erroneous, these derived values are not
      calculated, and are instead reported as missing. Therefore, these
      fields may be assumed to always be good (unflagged) data, except
      when they are reported as missing.
    F: >-
      The daily values reported in this dataset are calculated using
      multiple independent measurements for temperature and precipitation.
      USCRN/USRCRN stations have multiple co-located temperature sensors
      that make 10-second independent measurements which are used to
      produce max/min/avg temperature values at 5-minute intervals. The
      precipitation gauge is equipped with multiple load cell sensors to
      provide independent measurements of depth change at 5-minute
      intervals.
    G: >-
      On 2013-01-07 at 1500 UTC, USCRN began reporting corrected surface
      temperature measurements for some stations. These changes
      impact previous users of the data because the corrected values
      differ from uncorrected values. To distinguish between uncorrected
      (raw) and corrected surface temperature measurements, a surface
      temperature type field was added to the daily01 product. The
      possible values of the this field are "R" to denote raw surface
      temperature measurements, "C" to denote corrected surface
      temperature measurements, and "U" for unknown/missing.
    H: >-
      Relative humidity is computed from 5-minute values in almost all
      cases. All USCRN stations now report 5-minute averages, however the
      two Asheville, NC stations reported only hourly RH values until
      2007-02-22.
    I: >-
      USRCRN stations do not measure solar radiation, surface temperature,
      relative humidity or soil variables, so those fields are shown as
      missing data.
    J: >-
      USCRN stations have multiple co-located soil sensors that record
      independent measurements. The soil values reported in this dataset
      are an average of the day's hourly soil measurements which are
      calculated from the multiple independent measurements. Soil
      moisture is the ratio of water volume over sample volume
      (m^3 water/m^3 soil).
    K: >-
      In accordance with Service Change Notice 14-25 from the National
      Weather Service, NCDC stopped providing data from the 72
      Southwest Regional Climate Reference Network (USRCRN) stations on
      June 1, 2014. The historical data for these stations remain
      available.
