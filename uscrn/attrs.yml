    A: All fields are separated from adjacent fields by at least one space.
    B: Leading zeros are omitted.
    C: >-
      Missing data are indicated by the lowest possible integer for a
      given column format, such as -9999.0 for 7-character fields with
      one decimal place or -99.000 for 7-character fields with three
      decimal places.
    D: >-
      Hourly data are calculated over the 60-minute period *ending*
      at the time shown.
    E: >-
      Calculated fields, such as T_CALC and P_CALC, do not have quality
      flags associated with them because these are derived quantities
      from raw data. When the raw data used in the calculation are
      flagged as erroneous, the derived values are not calculated, and
      are instead reported as missing. Therefore, these fields may be
      assumed to always be good (unflagged) data, except when they are
      reported as missing.
    F: >-
      The hourly values reported in this dataset are calculated using
      multiple independent measurements for temperature and precipitation.
      USCRN/USRCRN stations have multiple co-located temperature sensors
      that make 10-second independent measurements which are used to
      produce max/min/avg temperature values at 5-minute intervals. The
      precipitation gauge is equipped with multiple load cell sensors to
      provide independent measurements of depth change at 5-minute
      intervals.
    G: >-
      Quality control flags indicate the following: 0 denotes good data
      and 3 denotes erroneous data.
    H: >-
      On 2013-01-07 at 1500 UTC, USCRN began reporting corrected surface
      temperature measurements for some stations. These changes
      impact previous users of the data because the corrected values
      differ from uncorrected values. To distinguish between uncorrected
      (raw) and corrected surface temperature measurements, a surface
      temperature type field was added to the data product. The
      possible values of the this field are "R" to denote raw surface
      temperature measurements, "C" to denote corrected surface
      temperature measurements, and "U" for unknown/missing.
    I: >-
      Hourly relative humidity is computed from 5-minute averages in
      almost all cases, however the two Asheville, NC stations reported
      only hourly RH values until 2007-02-22.
    J: >-
      USRCRN stations do not measure solar radiation, surface temperature,
      relative humidity or soil variables, so those fields are shown as
      missing data.
    K: >-
      USCRN stations have multiple co-located soil sensors that record
      independent measurements at 5-minute intervals. The hourly soil
      values reported in this dataset are calculated from these multiple
      independent measurements. Average soil moisture (volumetric water
      content) is the ratio of water volume over sample volume
      (m^3 water/m^3 soil).
    L: >-
      In accordance with Service Change Notice 14-25 from the National
      Weather Service, NCDC stopped providing data from the 72
      Southwest Regional Climate Reference Network (USRCRN) stations on
      June 1, 2014. The historical data for these stations remain
      available.
